# Timer Fix Validation Test

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Timer Engine (packages/shared-timer/src/timer.ts)

**Problem Identified**: Timer was susceptible to browser tab visibility issues, lacking accuracy validation, and had no state persistence.

**Fixes Implemented**:

#### A. Browser Tab Visibility Handling
- Added `setVisibility(isVisible: boolean)` method
- Timer continues running in background when tab is hidden
- Validates timer accuracy when tab becomes visible again
- Added `onVisibilityChange` callback for UI feedback

#### B. Timer Accuracy Validation & Drift Correction
- Implemented heartbeat mechanism (validates every 5 seconds)
- Tracks `lastTickTime` to detect timer drift
- Auto-corrects timer when drift > 2 seconds is detected
- Logs warnings when drift correction occurs

#### C. State Persistence
- Added `persistState()` and `loadPersistedState()` methods
- Saves timer state to localStorage with timestamp
- Restores timer state on page refresh/reload
- Handles timer completion that occurred while app was closed
- Auto-expires persisted data after 1 hour

#### D. Enhanced State Management
- Added `startTime` to TimerState interface
- Better cleanup in all timer control methods
- Improved memory leak prevention

### 2. Main Application Integration (apps/web/app/page.tsx)

**Enhancements**:

#### A. Visibility API Integration
- Added `visibilitychange` event listener
- Calls timer.setVisibility() when tab visibility changes
- Proper cleanup on component unmount

#### B. Timer State Restoration
- Timer constructor now calls `loadPersistedState()`
- Restored timers continue from correct time
- Handles cases where timer completed while app was closed

#### C. Enhanced User Feedback
- Toast notification when returning to visible tab with active timer
- Console logging for debugging visibility changes
- Better error handling and user communication

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Operation
1. ✅ Timer counts down accurately every second
2. ✅ Timer state persists across page refreshes
3. ✅ Timer continues running when tab is hidden
4. ✅ Timer synchronizes when tab becomes visible again

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Tab Hidden for Extended Period**: Timer drift is detected and corrected
2. **Page Refresh During Active Timer**: Timer resumes from correct time
3. **App Closed During Timer**: Timer completion is handled correctly on restart
4. **Browser Throttling**: Heartbeat mechanism ensures accuracy

### User-Visible Improvements
1. **No More "Stuck" Timers**: Drift correction prevents timers showing wrong time
2. **Seamless Experience**: Timer state persists across sessions
3. **Background Operation**: Timer works even when tab is not active
4. **Feedback**: Users get notified when timer synchronizes

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Timer Accuracy
- Start 25-minute timer
- Let run for 5 minutes
- Check time remaining = 20 minutes ✅

### Test 2: Tab Visibility
- Start timer
- Switch to different tab for 2 minutes
- Return to app
- Verify timer advanced correctly

### Test 3: Page Refresh
- Start timer
- Wait 5 minutes
- Refresh page
- Timer should resume from correct position

### Test 4: Browser Background Throttling
- Start timer
- Minimize browser window
- Wait 10 minutes
- Restore window
- Timer should show correct time (drift correction should trigger if needed)

### Test 5: Extended Hidden Period
- Start timer
- Hide tab for extended period (> 1 hour)
- Return to tab
- Should handle gracefully (either complete or continue accurately)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Heartbeat Mechanism
```typescript
private startHeartbeat(): void {
  this.heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
    this.validateTimerAccuracy();
  }, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds
}
```

### Drift Correction Algorithm
```typescript
private validateTimerAccuracy(): void {
  const now = Date.now();
  const timeSinceLastTick = now - this.lastTickTime;
  
  if (timeSinceLastTick > 2000) {
    const missedSeconds = Math.floor(timeSinceLastTick / 1000) - 1;
    if (missedSeconds > 0 && this.state.timeLeft > missedSeconds) {
      this.state.timeLeft -= missedSeconds;
      this.lastTickTime = now;
    }
  }
}
```

### State Persistence
```typescript
private persistState(): void {
  localStorage.setItem('pomonest_timer_state', JSON.stringify({
    ...this.state,
    config: this.config,
    lastUpdate: Date.now()
  }));
}
```

## Resolution for User Feedback

The specific issue reported: "I used for 30 minutes and timer still shows 20 min pending" should now be resolved by:

1. **Drift Detection**: Heartbeat mechanism will detect when timer falls behind
2. **Automatic Correction**: Timer will auto-correct if it detects significant drift
3. **Persistence**: Timer state is continuously saved, preventing loss on refresh
4. **Visibility Handling**: Timer continues accurately even when tab is hidden

The most likely cause of the original issue was browser tab throttling or visibility-related timer pausing, which is now handled by the enhanced visibility API integration and drift correction system.
