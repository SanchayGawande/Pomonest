```
üßµ Why the Pomodoro Technique works better than any other focus method (a thread)

1/ The average knowledge worker checks email every 6 minutes. Our brains aren't designed for this constant switching.

2/ The Pomodoro Technique fights this by creating "attention barriers" - 25-minute periods where switching is not allowed.

3/ But here's what most people get wrong: they think it's about the timer. It's actually about training your brain to sustain focus.

4/ After 30 days of consistent 25-minute sessions, most people report:
‚Ä¢ 40% longer natural focus spans
‚Ä¢ 60% less mental fatigue
‚Ä¢ 3x better task completion rates

5/ The secret isn't the 25 minutes - it's the habit of starting. Lower the barrier to begin, and everything else follows.

6/ Try it right now: Pick ONE task, set 25 minutes, and focus. No email, no phone, no switching.

7/ What's your biggest focus challenge? Reply and let's solve it together üëá

Built this into @pomonest because focus shouldn't be hard. It should be habitual.
