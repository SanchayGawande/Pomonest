**Email 2: Gentle Reminder + Tips (Day 2 if inactive)**
```
Subject: One quick technique that doubles focus time

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't started your second session yet - no worries! Life gets busy.

Here's a game-changing tip from our most successful users:

🎯 **The "2-Minute Rule"**: Can't start a 25-minute session? Try just 2 minutes.

Often, starting is the hardest part. Once you begin, momentum takes over.

Try it now: [2-Minute Quick Session]

P.S. This trick works for any task - exercise, reading, cleaning. Lower the barrier, build the habit.
```

**Email 3: Success Stories (Day 5 if still inactive)**
```
Subject: "I went from 2 hours to 6 hours of productivity daily"

Hi [First Name],

Meet Sarah, a PomoNest user who transformed her study habits:

"I was getting C's in organic chemistry and felt overwhelmed by everything. The 25-minute chunks made it manageable. Now I'm getting A's and actually enjoy studying."

The secret? She started with just one session per day.

  addTag('engaged_user')
  removeTag('new_user')
  startActivationWorkflow()
}

// Progressive feature introduction
const featureIntroSequence = [
  { day: 1, feature: 'streak_tracking' },
  { day: 4, feature: 'analytics_preview' },
  { day: 7, feature: 'premium_themes' },
  { day: 14, feature: 'advanced_insights' },

### 3. Pro Conversion Workflow

**Trigger**: User views Pro features or upgrade prompts
**Goal**: Convert interested users to Pro subscribers
**Duration**: 7 days with follow-up

**Segmentation Strategy**:
```typescript
interface ProProspect {
  trigger: 'upgrade_prompt_view' | 'analytics_click' | 'theme_lock' | 'feature_limit'
  context: {
    streak?: number
    sessionsCompleted?: number
    featureInterested?: string
  }
  engagementLevel: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}

// Dynamic content based on trigger
const getProContent = (prospect: ProProspect) => {
  switch(prospect.trigger) {
    case 'theme_lock':
      return themes_focused_sequence
    case 'analytics_click':
      return insights_focused_sequence

### 4. Re-engagement Workflow

**Trigger**: No app activity for 14 days
**Goal**: Bring inactive users back to the app
**Duration**: 10 days

**Segmentation by Previous Engagement**:
```typescript
interface InactiveUser {
  lastActive: Date
  totalSessions: number
  longestStreak: number
  previousEngagement: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  churnRisk: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}

// Personalized re-engagement based on history
const getReengagementStrategy = (user: InactiveUser) => {
  if (user.longestStreak >= 7) {
    return 'streak_builder_return'
  } else if (user.totalSessions >= 10) {
    return 'experienced_user_return'
  } else {
    return 'beginner_friendly_return'
  }
}
```

**Email Sequence**:

**Email 1: Personal Check-in (Day 14 of inactivity)**
```

**Goal**: Create omnichannel user experience
**Duration**: Ongoing

**Integration Points**:
```typescript
interface TouchpointData {
  source: 'social_media' | 'blog' | 'referral' | 'product_hunt' | 'search'
  content: string
  utm_campaign: string
  user_intent: 'education' | 'trial' | 'comparison' | 'purchase'

    social_retargeting: setupRetargetingAds(touchpoint.source),
    content_recommendations: getRelatedContent(touchpoint.content)
  }
}
```

## 🤖 Technical Implementation

### 1. ConvertKit Automation Setup

**API Integration**:
```typescript
// src/lib/automation.ts
export class AutomationEngine {
  private convertKit = new ConvertKitAPI()
  
  async triggerWorkflow(userId: string, workflow: WorkflowType, context?: any) {
    const user = await this.getUserData(userId)
    const triggers = this.getWorkflowTriggers(workflow)
    
    // Add user to appropriate sequence
    await this.convertKit.addSubscriberToSequence(
      user.email,
      triggers.sequenceId,
      { ...user, ...context }
    )
    
    // Track automation event
    analytics.track('Automation Triggered', {
      workflow,
      userId,
      context
    })
  }
  
  async updateUserSegment(userId: string, newSegment: UserSegment) {
    const user = await this.getUserData(userId)
    
    // Remove from old segments
    await this.convertKit.removeTag(user.email, user.currentSegment)
    
    // Add to new segment
    await this.convertKit.addTag(user.email, newSegment)
    
    // Update local database
    await this.updateUserDatabase(userId, { segment: newSegment })
  }
}
```

### 2. Behavior Tracking & Triggers

**Event-Driven Automation**:
```typescript
// src/lib/behaviorTracking.ts
export class BehaviorTracker {
  private automation = new AutomationEngine()
  
  async trackUserAction(userId: string, action: UserAction) {
    const user = await this.getUserProfile(userId)
    const triggers = this.evaluateTriggers(user, action)
    
    for (const trigger of triggers) {
      await this.automation.triggerWorkflow(
        userId,
        trigger.workflow,
        trigger.context
      )
    }
  }
  
  private evaluateTriggers(user: UserProfile, action: UserAction): AutomationTrigger[] {
    const triggers: AutomationTrigger[] = []
    
    // New user onboarding
    if (action.type === 'session_complete' && user.totalSessions === 1) {
      triggers.push({
        workflow: 'new_user_onboarding',
        context: { firstSessionDate: new Date() }
      })
    }
    
    // Activation workflow
    if (action.type === 'session_complete' && user.totalSessions === 3) {
      triggers.push({
        workflow: 'activation',
        context: { activationDate: new Date() }
      })
    }
    
    // Pro conversion interest
    if (action.type === 'pro_feature_view') {
      triggers.push({
        workflow: 'pro_conversion',
        context: { 
          feature: action.data.feature,
          viewedAt: new Date()
        }
      })
    }
    
    return triggers
  }
}
```

### 3. Personalization Engine

**Dynamic Content System**:
```typescript
// src/lib/personalization.ts
export class PersonalizationEngine {
  generateEmailContent(user: UserProfile, template: EmailTemplate): EmailContent {
    const personalizedContent = {
      ...template,
      subject: this.personalizeSubject(template.subject, user),
      body: this.personalizeBody(template.body, user),
      cta: this.personalizeCTA(template.cta, user)
    }
    
    return personalizedContent
  }
  
  private personalizeSubject(subject: string, user: UserProfile): string {
    return subject
      .replace('{{firstName}}', user.firstName)
      .replace('{{streak}}', user.currentStreak.toString())
      .replace('{{sessions}}', user.totalSessions.toString())
  }
  
  private personalizeBody(body: string, user: UserProfile): string {
    // Dynamic content based on user behavior
    const insights = this.generateUserInsights(user)
    
    return body
      .replace('{{userInsights}}', insights)
      .replace('{{nextGoal}}', this.getNextGoal(user))
      .replace('{{recommendedFeature}}', this.getRecommendedFeature(user))
  }
  
  private generateUserInsights(user: UserProfile): string {
    if (user.longestStreak >= 30) {
      return "You're a streak champion! Your consistency is inspiring."
    } else if (user.totalSessions >= 50) {
      return "You're building serious focus momentum with 50+ sessions!"
    } else if (user.currentStreak >= 7) {
      return "A 7-day streak shows you're forming a real habit!"
    }
    return "Every session is progress toward stronger focus!"
  }
}
```

### 4. A/B Testing Integration

**Automated Test Management**:
```typescript
// src/lib/abTesting.ts
export class ABTestManager {
  async assignUserToTest(userId: string, testName: string): Promise<string> {
    const user = await this.getUserData(userId)
    const test = await this.getActiveTest(testName)
    
    // Consistent assignment based on user ID
    const variant = this.hashUserToVariant(userId, test.variants)
    
    // Track assignment
    await this.trackTestAssignment(userId, testName, variant)
    
    return variant
  }
  
  async getEmailVariant(userId: string, emailTemplate: string): Promise<EmailTemplate> {
    const variant = await this.assignUserToTest(userId, `email_${emailTemplate}`)
    
    return this.getEmailTemplate(emailTemplate, variant)
  }
  
  private hashUserToVariant(userId: string, variants: string[]): string {
    // Consistent hash-based assignment
    const hash = this.simpleHash(userId)
    const index = hash % variants.length
    return variants[index]
  }
}
```
