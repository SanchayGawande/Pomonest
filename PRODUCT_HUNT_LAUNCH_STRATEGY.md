1/ The average knowledge worker checks email every 6 minutes. We're more connected but less productive than ever.

2/ The Pomodoro Technique works, but most timers are just... timers. We wanted to build habits, not just track time.

3/ PomoNest adds streak tracking, beautiful themes, and analytics to make focusing genuinely enjoyable.

4/ Most importantly: no signup required. Open pomonest.com and start focusing in 5 seconds.

5/ We're live on @ProductHunt today! Your support would mean the world: [link]

What's your best focus tip? 👇"
