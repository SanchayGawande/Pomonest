      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Pomodoro Technique has revolutionized how millions of people approach work and study, transforming scattered attention into laser-focused productivity. This simple yet powerful time management method uses 25-minute work intervals to harness your brain's natural rhythms and dramatically improve concentration.
      </p>

      {/* Definition Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Understanding the Pomodoro Technique: Definition and Origins</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into focused 25-minute intervals called "pomodoros," followed by short 5-minute breaks. After completing four pomodoros, you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This cyclical approach to work leverages scientific principles about attention span and cognitive fatigue to maximize productivity while preventing burnout.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The History Behind the Method</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Francesco Cirillo developed the Pomodoro Technique in the late 1980s while struggling with university studies. Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro is Italian for tomato) he used to track his work sessions, this technique emerged from Cirillo's personal quest to find a sustainable way to maintain focus during long study periods.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        What started as a personal productivity hack has since been validated by decades of research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, confirming that the human brain naturally operates in cycles of high and low attention.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">How the Pomodoro Technique Works: Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Basic Pomodoro Process</h3>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 1: Choose Your Task</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">Select a specific task or project you want to work on. The key is focusing on a single objective rather than multitasking.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 2: Set Your Timer for 25 Minutes</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">Use a physical timer, smartphone app, or online Pomodoro timer. The 25-minute duration is scientifically optimized for sustained attention without mental fatigue.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 3: Work With Complete Focus</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">During the 25-minute session, eliminate all distractions. Turn off notifications, close unnecessary browser tabs, and commit fully to your chosen task.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 4: Take a 5-Minute Break</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">When the timer rings, immediately stop working and take a short break. Stand up, stretch, hydrate, or briefly step outside. Avoid activities that require significant mental energy.</p>

        <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step 5: Repeat the Cycle</h4>
        <p>Return to work for another 25-minute session. After completing four pomodoros, reward yourself with a longer break of 15-30 minutes.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Advanced Pomodoro Strategies</h3>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Task Estimation:</strong> Before starting, estimate how many pomodoros a task will require. This builds better time awareness and project planning skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Interruption Handling:</strong> When internal thoughts or external interruptions arise, quickly note them down and return to your task. Address these items during breaks or future pomodoros.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Tracking:</strong> Keep a record of completed pomodoros to identify your most productive times and track progress on larger projects.</li>
      </ul>

      {/* Science Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Science Behind 25-Minute Focus Sessions</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Cognitive Research Supporting the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Research in cognitive psychology reveals that the average human attention span for complex tasks ranges from 20-30 minutes before experiencing significant mental fatigue. The 25-minute pomodoro sits perfectly within this optimal focus window.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Attention Restoration Theory</strong> suggests that brief breaks allow the brain's directed attention systems to recover, preventing the cognitive overload that leads to decreased performance and decision fatigue.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        <strong>Ultradian Rhythms</strong> research shows that humans naturally cycle through periods of high and low alertness approximately every 90-120 minutes. The Pomodoro Technique aligns with these natural rhythms by providing regular recovery periods.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Neurological Benefits of Structured Breaks</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">The 5-minute breaks in the Pomodoro Technique aren't just rest periods—they're active recovery that:</p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Consolidates Learning:</strong> Short breaks help transfer information from working memory to long-term memory</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces Stress Hormones:</strong> Brief respites lower cortisol levels that accumulate during intense focus</li>
        <li><strong>Refreshes Attention Networks:</strong> The brain's attention systems reset, preparing for another high-quality focus session</li>
      </ul>

      {/* Benefits Section */}
      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Key Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique</h2>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Enhanced Focus and Concentration</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The time constraint of 25 minutes creates urgency that naturally improves focus. Knowing you only need to maintain attention for a short, defined period makes it easier to resist distractions and stay engaged with challenging tasks.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Reduced Procrastination and Task Avoidance</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Large projects often feel overwhelming, leading to procrastination. Breaking work into 25-minute chunks makes any task feel manageable, reducing the psychological barrier to getting started.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Better Time Awareness and Planning</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Regular practice with the Pomodoro Technique develops an intuitive sense of time. You'll become more accurate at estimating how long tasks take and better at planning realistic daily schedules.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Sustainable Productivity Without Burnout</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Unlike hustle culture approaches that promote working longer hours, the Pomodoro Technique emphasizes working smarter. The built-in breaks prevent mental exhaustion and maintain high-quality output throughout the day.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Dealing with Interruptions</h3>
      <p className="mb-2"><strong>The Challenge:</strong> External interruptions from colleagues, family, or urgent requests can break your flow.</p>
      <p className="mb-6"><strong>The Solution:</strong> Use the "inform, negotiate, schedule" approach. Inform others about your focused work time, negotiate the urgency of interruptions, and schedule non-urgent discussions for your break periods.</p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Tasks That Don't Fit 25-Minute Blocks</h3>
      <p className="mb-2"><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Some activities, like creative brainstorming or complex problem-solving, may require longer continuous focus.</p>
      <p className="mb-6"><strong>The Solution:</strong> Experiment with longer intervals (45-90 minutes) for deep work, or break complex tasks into smaller, 25-minute subtasks.</p>
